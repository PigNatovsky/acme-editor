# plan9port-config

# Installation

## Mac

I currently use a Macbook Air (13-inch, Early 2015) and the system version is
macOS Sierra 10.12.5.

### 1. Grap plan9port source code from github.
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/9fans/plan9port.git /usr/local/plan9
```
I put it at `/usr/local/` because the manual says it is the convention.
Alternatively, you can install plan9port via hombrew

``` bash
brew install plan9port
```
